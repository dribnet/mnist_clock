## MNIST clock

Digits rendered with a variational auto-encoder and 10 concept vectors in 8 dimensinoal latent space. The digit style changes as the concept vectos are applied to a drifting anchor point.

(note: neural net decoder weights are currently 6.5M and so will take a few seconds to load before clock starts)
